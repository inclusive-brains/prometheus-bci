# 🧠⚡ Prometheus BCI

## Overview

Prometheus BCI is an advanced platform for the collection and analysis of multimodal data, designed to support applications in neuroscience, biofeedback, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), based on Timeflux. It processes data from various devices and sensors, converting raw input into actionable metrics and insights for cognitive and physiological analysis.

## 🌟 Tribute to Nathalie and Pierre

Prometheus BCI’s first interface was born from a unique challenge: enabling **Nathalie Labrégère** to interact with an exoskeleton arm and carry the Olympic flame on May 9, 2024, in Marseille.

![Nathalie carrying the Olympic flame with the exoskeleton arm](https://c.nau.ch/i/8keaGJ/1800/nathalie-labregere-halt-dank-eines-gedankengesteuerten-exoskelett-die-olympische-fackel-nach-oben.avif)

Due to severe motor and cerebral disabilities, Nathalie could not use motor imagery commands; her only means of interacting with the world is through her facial expressions. Thanks to her determination, Prometheus BCI allowed her to control the exoskeleton arm using just those subtle facial movements.

A few weeks later, on July 24, 2024, **Pierre Landerretche** — also living with motor disabilities — carried the Olympic flame in Versailles, on the eve of the opening ceremony.

Their journeys are a tribute to the spirit of inclusion, resilience, and innovation.  
Prometheus BCI exists because of pioneers like Nathalie and Pierre, whose courage and stories inspire us to push the boundaries of assistive neurotechnology — for everyone.

This project is made possible thanks to the support of Allianz Trade, whose commitment to innovation and inclusion helps turn advanced AI and neurotechnology into real-world solutions for people with disabilities.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

First, install Timeflux in a clean environment :

```bash
conda create --name timeflux python=3.10 pytables
conda activate timeflux
```

### 2️⃣ Setup

Then, install the application from the Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inclusive-brains/prometheus-bci.git
cd prometheus-bci
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Updating

Get the latest version of the code and update the dependencies:

```bash
cd prometheus-bci
git pull
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

By default, the application uses random data. It can therefore be fully tested without an actual EEG headset.

Don't forget to activate your environment if you haven't already :

```bash
conda activate timeflux
```

Then simply run:

```bash
timeflux -d app.yaml
```

You can use the classic Timeflux monitoring interface or the Inclusive Brains UI to check the signal or start a new BCI session:

- http://localhost:8002/dashboard/
- http://localhost:8002/monitor/

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application is fully configurable via the `app.yaml` file and sub-graphs. For convenience, only the essential options are exposed in a `.env` environment file:

## 🧠 Devices

This application is hardware-agnostic, as long as the EEG system provides high-quality data and a consistent electrode montage. Each device is defined as a sub-graph and should provide its own preprocessing pipeline (filtering, channel selection, etc.).

Generic LSL devices can be added easily.

A random data graph is also available to test the interface without a real EEG device.

---

## 🎯 Calibration

A typical session begins with a calibration phase:

- **Baseline:** Currently unused, but enabled by default to provide data for further analysis.
- **Motor imagery:** With an Emotiv Epoch X headset (14 channels), 100 to 120 repetitions per class are needed.
- **Blinks:** Around 10-15 blinks followed by a rest period are sufficient for accurate classification.

---

## Recording

Raw EEG data and calibration events are recorded in HDF5 format in the `data` directory. Log files are stored in the `logs` directory.
